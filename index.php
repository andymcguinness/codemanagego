                    <p>Code, Manage, Go! is like task management on steroids. It allows you to combine your two favorite things--git and task management--into one neat app. Other apps have features that allow you to address bugs with commits; I think that's a great idea, and wanted to extend that to the process of <em>building</em> apps and projects, not just <em>supporting</em> them.</p>
                
                    <p>Some of Code, Manage, Go!'s great features include:</p>
