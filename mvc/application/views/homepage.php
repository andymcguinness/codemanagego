        <div class="main-content">
            <p>Code, Manage, Go! is like task management on steroids. It allows you to combine your two favorite things--git and task management--into one neat app. Other apps have features that allow you to address bugs with commits; I think that's a great idea, and wanted to extend that to the process of <em>building</em> apps and projects, not just <em>supporting</em> them.</p>

            <p>Some of Code, Manage, Go!'s great features include:</p>

            <ul class="features-list">
                <li><a href="">An intuitive profile page</a></li>
                <li><a href="">The ability to upload files to your projects</a></li>
                <li><a href="">The ability to review all files associated with your projects</a></li>
                <li><a href="">To-do lists, naturally</a></li>
                <li><a href="">The ability to review to-do lists and mark tasks complete</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>These are among some of the great features this webapp currently offers. Sign up today to get the full experience!</p>
